# Automatic Folder Monitor & File Sorter
## Overview:

This tool takes the hassle out of manually sorting your downloads folder, or any other folder you tend to just throw files into.
It will move files that fall under a category to a specified subfolder. It will also auto-unzip any zipped files for you.
So you can assign a bulk set of image extensions, and any time the script sees one in your monitored folder, it will move it to your "Images" folder.
Eg: `photo.jpg` > `Photos folder\photo.jpg`. `ZipFile.7z` > `ZipFile\ZipFileContents*.*`

Fully customizable to suit your needs!


## Initial Setup
1. Download and install 7zip or easy-7Zip (http://www.e7z.org/free-download.htm)
2. Download and install AutoHotKey (https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
3. Open the .ahk file in a text editor.
4. CHange the `UnzipToggle` value near the top to toggle unzip feature.
5. Change the `MonitoredFolder` value near the top of the script to point to the folder that you want to be monitored for changes.
6. Change `UnzipTo` value to point to where you want zip files to be unzipped to.
7. Change `HowOftenToScanInSeconds` To how often it should check if anything within the folder has changed.
8. Change the `7ZipLocation` to point to where your 7zip's 7z.exe is.
9. Under the `Destination folders` section, you can change where files that match a specific file type will be placed. Eg `MoveImagesTo = %MonitoredFolder%\Images`

## Adding more file types to a category
1. Starting on Line 28, add in the file extension to the list of file extensions on the `PushFiletypeToArray` command. Eg. `"jpeg"` and use a comma to seperate the entries.

## Adding custom categories
1. Copy and paste this onto a new line just after the last one on line 32, and adjust the file types within the `[ ]` brackets, and label what folder they go into at the end to what you'd like to use.

`PushFiletypeToArray(FiletypeObjectArray,["exe","msi","cmd"], "FolderNameGoesHere")`
